<!-- A Jekyll-based blog uses the same conventions that we've familiarized ourselves with in the previous steps.
But takes things further by adding a few more for us to follow. Jekyll is very flexible allowing you to extend your site as you wish.

and creating a custom permalink for posts, and creating an RSS feed for the blog -->
